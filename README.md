Fantasy World Generator

This small application generates fantasy world maps that are meant to be used for table top role playing. They are generic and not game specific. Generated maps can be printed to an image of a hex map and explored with ghci and corresponding library functions.
Generation is random and based largely on files in data/.

#TODO

 - Proper interface, render information to interactive html file.
  - clean up code and unused functions
   - Better executable interface (ask for map seed and specifications)
    - documentation
